> This alert created by company based in Ukraine from shelter.
> 
> 24 February 2022, Russia started bombing cities with peacefully civilized population in whole Ukraine. Breaking the laws of war. Their bombs has been killing children and adults. This deserves Hague court.
> - üè† If you are from Russia, please stop your government by any means including protests, don't trust local media, they are bribed by the government. They always was. I am sure you already feel lie by unexplainable crazy things in your country caused by world sanctions.
> - üí£ Please spread the information about bombing of Ukraine in all social way you could. Russia treacherously broke into the territory of a sovereign state. Do not trust to anything from Russian media, most likely it will be bullshit
> - üíº If you have any kind of business cooperation with Russia, please block it now and keep most of money on your side, this is the only possible ethical decision
> - ‚ò¢Ô∏è Ask your government to stop Russia from spreading invasion in any way. Russia is nuclear threat to the whole world. You think it is not possible? We thought that bombing of independent country with population of 44.13 million is also not possible.

# How to self-host it

This repo holds a `Dockerfile` with all needed (Correct version of Python and all dependencies which are managed via Pipenv).

Example of instantiation, e.g. Docker Compose:

```

services:
  imagetotext:
    network_mode: host
    build: <path_to_this_repo>
    command: /bin/bash -c "cd /code/ && pipenv run uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8314 --workers 6"
    restart: always

```

Then you can use `http://<ip_of_server>:8314` or use any proxy server to route requests to port 8314, e.g. Nginx:



```
# imagetotext.app
server {
    server_name imagetotext.app;
    listen 80;
    
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/cert/$CERT_NAME.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/cert/$CERT_NAME.key;

    charset utf-8;
    client_max_body_size 75M;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Authorization "";
        proxy_connect_timeout 400s;
        proxy_read_timeout 400s;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $$http_host;
        proxy_redirect off;
        
        proxy_buffers 128 8k; 
        proxy_buffer_size 16k;

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8314;

        add_header Last-Modified $$date_gmt;
        etag off;
    }
}
```



# Run dev autorelaod server locally

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 (Native and [WSL 2](https://hinty.io/ivictbor/simple-way-to-docker-on-windows-10-home-with-wsl-2/)):

1\. Install deps


```
apt install tesseract-ocr libtesseract-dev libleptonica-dev pkg-config
```

>  ‚ö† Do this before `pipenv sync`


Tesseract should have version `4.1.1+`.

2\. Then enter a repo dir and do:

```
pipenv sync
```

3\. Run app:

```
pipenv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

# Testing and troubleshooting

üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è To fix any exception produced by python code use [fixexception.com](http://fixexception.com/) ‚Äì works very well üí™

```
curl -d '{"base64":"baeldung"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload/
```

Or paste same JSON in `testreq.json` file and run:

```
curl -d @testreq.json -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload/
```

To test only tesseract on your computer:

```
tesseract `absolute path to any image with text (/home/ykorolikhin/Pictures/test_text.png)` stdout 
```
